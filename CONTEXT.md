# BuddyTrip — Session Context

## Last Updated
2026-03-09 — Task 0.3 complete

## Current State
- buddytrip.html: ~4730 lines
- All known icon references verified against ICONS dict
- Team scores are now computed from data, not hardcoded

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 0.1 — Send icon added to ICONS dict (line 197)
- [x] 0.2 — Competition Explainer icon rendering fix (line 1679)
- [x] 0.3 — computeTeamScores(event) function added (~line 462); replaces hardcoded scores in Dashboard, HomeTab (TripDetail), and LiveLeaderboard

## Notes from 0.3
- Old hardcoded values (6.5/8.5) did NOT match mock data — they were arbitrary placeholders
- Computed values from ROUND_RESULTS + sides[].result: team-a: 10, team-b: 13
- This is correct behavior — the prototype is now self-consistent and data-driven

## In Progress
- [ ] 0.4 — Fix expense split using first names instead of user IDs

## Known Issues / Notes
- raw.githubusercontent.com blocked in Claude chat container
- ICONS dict: any missing icon fails silently (empty SVG, no error)
